### Description ###

YTDL Command Builder is a helper app that assists you in installing and using the `youtube-dl` command line utility on your Android device.

With YTDL Command Builder, you can easily search through all the available options in `youtube-dl` and save frequently-used commands for easier access and minimal typing.

Share video and playlist URLs directly to YTDL Command Builder to immediately generate a `youtube-dl` command that you can easily transfer to any command line environment!


**Note:** 
YTDL Command Builder does NOT do any downloading or logic by itself, and is not associated or affiliated with the amazing folks working on [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) or [Termux](https://termux.com/).

I'm just a huge fan of their work. \\(^_^)/
